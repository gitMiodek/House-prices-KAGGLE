# This repository contains my project predicting house prices based on Kaggle dataset.
The helper README simply describes main steps that I made in order to acomplish the task.
## Things done
The things I have already done:
- data acquisition
- data visualisation
- handling missing values
- droping obvious outliars
- droping features that have literally no impact on a target prediction
- encoding categorical features
## Things to do
The things that are planned to do:
- add more features basing on data analysis
- add features based on PCA/Clustering
- Detect and drop more ouliars (mby using PCA)
> Drop highly correlated featuress
- Standardize/normalize distibution of data
- Final visualisation
- Start working with models
